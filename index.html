          <p><img id="logo" src="images/Harvard_shield-Public_Health.png">Interested in both development and implementation of analysis infrastructure for large data sets. Experienced in applying high-throughput technology to complex diseases. Focused on applying next-generation sequencing, and microarray chip technology to basic and translational experimentation, explicitly when related to clinical studies. <br><br> Most recently, have been developing methodology and associated software for analysis of metagenomic data sets and statistical techniques for microbial biomarker detection.</p>

        <p>At my core I have always enjoyed the art of programming and have leveraged this in a variety of environments. Originally, I started my career at the Vanguard Group, programing and testing Java financial web applications for the small business services group. Over the next years, I obtained a PhD in Bioinformatics and Computational biology, working on developing computational and statistical analysis of ovarian tumors and inflammatory bowel disease. Over the years I have developed automated statistical analyses, made custom visualizations of scientific data, developed metagenomic study design methodology using data mining / machine learning techniques, worked with creating specialized biological databases, worked with terabytes of data, and developed bioinformatics inferences methods. I am excited about what a team of passionate people can do, and am excited to continue creating!</p>
